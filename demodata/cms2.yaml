  opportunity:
    description: "The public school of SU Pasto is a Montessori-based school located in the town of Aibonito, Puerto Rico and operated by the Instituto Nueva Escuela. After hurricanes Maria and Irma affected the island of Puerto Rico, the school was out of power for over 6 months. However, it operated as a defacto community shelter since its Parent-Teacher Association is a strong cohesive group in the Aibonito community. The school had an emergency generator and was able to cater to community needs during the aftermath. The most important aspect missing for the school was a resilient telecommunication system to connect with first responders."
